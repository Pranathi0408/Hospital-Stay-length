# 🏥 Predicting Hospital Stay Length using Explainable Machine Learning

This mini project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the number of days a patient is expected to stay in a hospital based on clinical and personal features. The project also uses explainable machine learning to help interpret the model's predictions in a transparent and trustworthy way.


## 📘 Project Title

**Predicting Hospital Stay Length using Explainable Machine Learning**


## 🎯 Objective

- To apply machine learning algorithms for predicting hospital stay duration.
- To use explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret model predictions.
- To support hospital management in planning and patient care decisions.


## 🧪 Problem Statement

Hospitals often face challenges in managing patient flow and resource allocation. Accurately predicting how long a patient will stay helps in bed planning, staffing, and reducing healthcare costs. This project solves this problem using machine learning techniques enhanced with explainability tools like SHAP
